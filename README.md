### Vercel

We recommend deploying to [Vercel](https://vercel.com/?utm_source=t3-oss&utm_campaign=oss). It makes it super easy to deploy NextJs apps.

- Go to [Vercel](https://vercel.com/?utm_source=t3-oss&utm_campaign=oss) and sign up with GitHub.
- Create a Project and import the repository you pushed your code to.
- Add your environment variables.
- Click **Deploy**
- Now whenever you push a change to your repository, Vercel will automatically redeploy your website!
